Solutions to problems while building weston locally:

Dependency libdrm found: NO found 2.4.91 but need: '>= 2.4.108'
https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/libdrm.html
(installed .tar.gz for libdrm and built it using run.meson -> $WLD path for installation)

protocol/meson.build:4:0: ERROR: Neither a subproject directory nor a wayland-protocols.wrap file was found.
(dependency wayland-protocols.pc was in /home/anupam/Wayland/install/share/pkgconfig, added to PKG_CONFIG_PATH in Install.sh)

logind support requires libsystemd >= 209. Or, you can use '-Dlauncher-logind=false
sudo apt-get install libsystemd-dev
sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev

Run-time dependency libseat found: NO (tried pkgconfig and cmake)
libweston/meson.build:197:1: ERROR: Dependency "libseat" not found, tried pkgconfig and cmake
(https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/seatd/  ? or time to build libinput? (seats))..

Disabled this dependency by reading README.txt and checking meson_options.txt. Whatever I don't
need, I pass -D<var_name> to run.meson

but: 
libweston/backend-drm/meson.build:49:2: ERROR: Problem encountered: drm-backend with GL renderer requires gbm which was not found. Or, you can use '-Drenderer-gl=false'.
(do I need mesa at this point? who provides the gbm interface for drm-backend? how did I compile libdrm: libdrm does not have any gbm stuff)

for the moment go with -Drenderer-gl=false' although this should be re-enabled...
actually: sudo apt-get install libgbm-dev

Problem encountered: RDP-backend requires freerdp >= 2.3.0 which was not found. Or, you can use '-Dbackend-rdp=false'.
- wow ! does weston work with RDP (remote desktop protocol)?

Problem encountered: Pipewire plugin requires libpipewire which was not found. If you rather not build this, set '-Dpipewire=false'.

Looks like gbm is an older version..
Dependency gbm found: NO found 18.0.5 but need: '>= 21.1.1' (cached)
Message: dmabuf-feedback requires gbm which was not found. If you rather not build this, drop "dmabuf-feedback" from simple-clients option.

clients/meson.build:46:0: ERROR: Dependency 'gbm' is required but not found.
so I went into clients and removed dmabuf-feedback section in its meson.build.

This finally compiled weston and installed it in $WLD!
This is latest weston..


btw: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/+package/weston = weston 1.9.0-3 for Xenial (Ubuntu 16.04 which is mine currently)
